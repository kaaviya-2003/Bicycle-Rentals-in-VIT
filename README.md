# Bicycle-Rentals-in-VIT
This system is named as Bicycle Rental System. It is designed to help the students 
to take bicycles for rent. In this system, bicycle owners who want to give their bicycles 
for rent can register themselves and add their bicycle details. The customers can register 
themselves as renters, they search for the bicycle that they want to rent and take that
bicycle for rent. Details of both the customers and the sellers will be taken and validated 
to avoid mistakes. Bicycle parked location is required because customer can take the 
bicycle only by going to that location.
This system allow customers to choose a bicycle according to their need and take 
that bicycle on rent. Sellers will be able to earn money by giving their bicycle on rent. 
When the customer take a bicycle on rent, the time that they use bicycle will be recorded. 
After the usage of that rented bicycle, customer will park the bicycle at some location and 
enters that location. After the completion of ride, the amount will be calculated according 
to the time that they used the bicycle.
This project can be implemented in many large universities. Here, we have 
considered implementing this project for Vellore Institute of Technology. There are many 
academic blocks and hostel blocks in Vellore Institute of Technology. So, students can 
make use of this system and travel, explore the campus. This system helps the students to 
decrease stress levels, strengthen bones, increase fitness, muscle strength and flexibility.
